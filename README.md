ProjectEuler
============
This will be a series of small programs / utilities that can be used for solving problems on Project Euler -- And similar problems that follow the same logic as the ones they have posted.

When creating a program/class to (help) solve a problem, please include the full problem as a comment at the beginning of the class (or in a separate README file such as Problem1_README).

An example of this would be to have the following text in a file called Problem1_README:

"
Multiples of 3 and 5

Problem 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
